# boardkit

Deploy Grafana boards and decide who sees them, from one declaration per repo.

```bash
pip install "boardkit @ git+https://github.com/Sety-project/boardkit@v0.1.1"
boardkit plan   boards.toml      # validate; show the groups it will make
boardkit deploy boards.toml      # ship to the audience's host and apply there
```

## The declaration (in the repo, next to its boards)

```toml
project     = "risk"
audience    = "internal"     # internal -> the team host; me -> the owner's own host
sensitivity = "sensitive"    # sensitive | open

[datasources]                # reference used in the board JSON -> logical name
"${DS_MAIN}" = "main"

[[folders]]
uid     = "risk"
title   = "Risk"
viewers = ["ops@example.com"]     # the whole folder; "all" = every account (open only)
tabs    = true                    # boards with rows become real tabs

  [[folders.boards]]
  file    = "grafana/book-a.json"
  viewers = ["client-a@example.com"]   # this board only
  home    = true                       # it is their home page
  preference_vars = ["loss"]           # kept even under --reset-vars
```

What a deploy does, on the host:

1. **Refuses** if the declaration breaks its policy: a sensitive project on a
   host with anonymous access, or granting "all".
2. **Publishes** each board: the folder by uid, datasource references rewired to
   the host's own datasources (an unmapped one is an error), rows turned into
   real tabs if asked, the values viewers chose in dropdowns carried over, and
   the board **read back** and compared.
3. **Converges access**: one team per group, members exactly the declared
   emails, View on the folder or the board, the board as the team's home page;
   every other grant on the project's folders and boards removed (Admin-level
   grants stay). Addresses without an account get a Viewer invite link, which
   the deploy prints for you to send.

The host re-applies every stored project on a timer (`boardkit apply --all
--access-only`) so that people who register are seated without a redeploy.

## The host inventory (private, on each machine)

`~/.config/boardkit/hosts.toml` (or `$BOARDKIT_HOSTS`) names the hosts, which
audience each serves, how to reach it, where its admin credentials are and its
datasource uids. See `boardkit/hosts.py`. It is never committed anywhere public.

## Other commands

* `boardkit apply --project P | --all [--access-only]` runs on the host itself.
* `boardkit audit` prints what the host's Grafana *enforces*: anonymous access,
  invite lifetime, accounts, teams, pending invites and every folder's grants,
  with flags for what the policy forbids.

Design, the tools compared before building this, and the Grafana behaviours it
relies on: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Tests

`pytest` runs the unit tests plus an end-to-end journey against a real Grafana
OSS container (docker): deploy, register through the invite flow, seat, then log
in as each viewer and check what they can open.
